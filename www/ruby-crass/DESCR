Crass is a Ruby CSS parser that's fully compliant with the
CSS Syntax Level 3 specification.

Features
--------

* Pure Ruby, with no runtime dependencies other than Ruby 1.9.x or higher.

* Tokenizes and parses CSS according to the rules defined in the 14 November
  2014 editor's draft of the [CSS Syntax Level 3][css] specification.

* Extremely tolerant of broken or invalid CSS. If a browser can handle it, Crass
  should be able to handle it too.

* Optionally includes comments in the token stream.

* Optionally preserves certain CSS hacks, such as the IE "*" hack, which would
  otherwise be discarded according to CSS3 tokenizing rules.

* Capable of serializing the parse tree back to CSS while maintaining all
  original whitespace, comments, and indentation.
