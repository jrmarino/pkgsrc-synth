HTTP::Tinyish is a wrapper module for HTTP client modules LWP,
HTTP::Tiny and HTTP client software curl and wget.

It provides an API compatible to HTTP::Tiny, and the implementation has
been extracted out of App::cpanminus.  This module can be useful in a
restrictive environment where you need to be able to download CPAN
modules without an HTTPS support in built-in HTTP library.
