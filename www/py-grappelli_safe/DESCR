grappelli_safe is a permanent fork of Grappelli admin skin for Django, to be
referenced as a dependency for the Mezzanine CMS for Django.

At the time of grappelli_safe's creation, Grappelli was incorrectly packaged
on PyPI, and had also dropped compatibility with Django 1.1 - grappelli_safe
was therefore created to address these specific issues.
