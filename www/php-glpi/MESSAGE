To run GLPI, you need a web server set up to run PHP scripts;
${PREFIX}/share/examples/glpi/http-glpi.conf is a sample 
configuration for Apache. In addition, you need access to a MySQL server.

To set up or upgrade GLPI, activate the setup page:

cd ${PREFIX}/share/glpi/install && mv install.php.disabled install.php

Then, open <http://localhost/glpi>.

Rename install.php when you are done.
