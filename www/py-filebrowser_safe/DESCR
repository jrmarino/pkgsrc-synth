filebrowser_safe is a permanent fork of FileBrowser asset manager for Django,
to be referenced as a dependency for the Mezzanine CMS for Django.

At the time of filebrowser_safe's creation, FileBrowser was incorrectly
packaged on PyPI, and had also dropped compatibility with Django 1.1 -
filebrowser_safe was therefore created to address these specific issues.
