Phalcon is an open source full stack framework for PHP, written as a
C-extension. Phalcon is optimized for high performance. Its unique architecture
allows the framework to always be memory resident, offering its functionality
whenever its needed, without expensive file stats and file reads that
traditional PHP frameworks employ.
