libepubgen is a library for generating documents in (surprise!) EPUB format,
implementing librevenge document interfaces. It supports conversion of text
documents, presentations and vector drawings. Spreadsheets are not supported,
because conversion of a spreadsheet to EPUB does not (IMHO) make much sense. As
these interfaces are used by multiple libraries, libepubgen can be used to
generate EPUB from many sources.

libepubgen requires boost and librevenge to build. It also needs doxygen to
generate API documentation (can be disabled by passing --without-docs to
configure).
