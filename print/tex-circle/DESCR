This package provides circles in math mode that can be used for the
nextstep operator of temporal logic, in conjunction with \Box and
\Diamond (latexsym) or \square and \lozenge (amssymb).  LaTeX circles
\circ and \bigcirc are not of the right size.  The circles are taken
from the font lcircle10.  The package contains some hacks to
approximate the right size and this solution is definitely not
sufficient to give a high quality output.
