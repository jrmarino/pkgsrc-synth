# gutenprint has many options, and really should be split into
# multiple packages.  Splitting is difficult because of the structure
# of the upstream distribution.  For now, this package contains
# everything that gdt wants, because that seems more useful to users
# than not having gutenprint in pkgsrc.

# Adjust configure to disable components that we don't want.  Note
# components that should eventually be in split packages.  Options
# that are on by default are commented out.  Options that default to
# on or off and are not particularly interesting are not mentioned.

# gdt doesn't understand what this means.
# --enable-nls-macosx     build CUPS PPD files [(automatic)]

# cups ppds (separate from cups support, probably)
# Note that the default is to install a program which generates ppds,
# rather than large numbers of ppds.
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-cups-ppds
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-cups-1_2-enhancements
# Disable translated ppds.  Without this option, there are dozens of
# copies of each printer, differing in the CUPS UI only by a language
# code.  The awkwardness seems to outweigh the benefit.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-translated-cups-ppds
# --enable-globalized-cups-ppds (auto)

# Respect upstream's judgement about this issue, without understanding.
# --enable-static-genppd

# GTK2 ui (on by default)
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-libgutenprintui2

# Sample images are small, so let them be included.
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-samples

# escputil is a utility for Epson printers.  It should arguably be in
# a split package, but it's small and useful so splitting isn't worth
# the effort.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+= --enable-escputil

# test pattern generator.  Small, so let it be built
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-test
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-testpattern

# CUPS support, on by default.  This should be in a split package.
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-cups

# 201105: Reevaluate what this means and whether we want it.
# Foomatic support.  This should be in a split package, if at all.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-foomatic
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-foomatic3

# Ghostscript support.  This should be in a split package, if at all.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-ghostscript

# Something in gutenprint seems to use readline, but it's not clear
# why, so just disable it to reduce dependencies.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-readline

# gimp2 plugin, on by default, and named gutenprint
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-gimp2
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-gimp2-as-gutenprint

# XXX Make command.types be a CONF_FILE

# Tests fail unless the package is installed because they use
# /usr/pkg/libexec/cups/filter/rastertogutenprint.5.2 rather than
# the pre-installed version.  Reported upstream 20150910.
