Thomas Esser's teTeX is _the_ TeX distribution for UNIX compatible
systems.  It contains the latest versions of TeX & friends and
nearly everything you need for happy TeX'ing.

This is the meta-package.  teTeX is being replaced in pkgsrc with TeX
Live.  If you would like a full TeX setup via pkgsrc, this is
currently the best package to install.
