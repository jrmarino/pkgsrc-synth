The tracklang package is provided for package developers who
want a simple interface to find out which languages the user
has requested through packages such as babel or polyglossia.
This package does not provide any translations! Its purpose is
simply to track which languages have been requested by the
user. Generic TeX code is in tracklang.tex for non-LaTeX users.
