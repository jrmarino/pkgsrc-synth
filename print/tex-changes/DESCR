The package allows the user to manually markup changes of text,
such as additions, deletions, or replacements. Changed text is
shown in a different colour; deleted text is crossed out. The
package allows definition of additional authors and their
associated colour. It also allows you to define a markup for
authors or annotations. A bash script is provided for removing
the changes.
