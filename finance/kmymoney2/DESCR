KMyMoney intends to be the best Personal Finance Manager for free
users, full stop.

The ultimate objectives of KMyMoney are:

    * Accuracy. Using time tested double entry accounting principles
    KMyMoney can help ensure that your finances are kept in correct
    order.
    * Ease of use. KMyMoney strives to be the easiest open source
    personal finance manager to use, especially for the non-technical
    user.
    * Familiar Features. KMyMoney intends to provide all important
    features found in the commercially-available, personal finance
    managers. The current release is closer than ever to that goal
    and more improvements are already planned or being tested.
