ibus.el is a IBus client for GNU Emacs.  This program allows users on-the-spot
style input with IBus.  The input statuses are individually kept for each
buffer, and prefix-keys such as C-x and C-c can be used even if IBus is active.
So you can input various languages fast and comfortably by using it.
