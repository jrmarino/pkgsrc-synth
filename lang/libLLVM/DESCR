The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual
machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build
them.

This package contains the LLVM core shared libraries intended to be usable by
packages built on an otherwise GCC-built system.

This package (lang/libLLVM) is libLLVM 4.0.  While it could be renamed
to libLLVM4, that has not happened -- but it is intended to be a fixed
version.  lang/libLLVM provides 3.4, for depending packages that need
an even older version.
