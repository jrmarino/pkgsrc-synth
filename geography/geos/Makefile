# geos has two libraries:
#   geos_c (C), which follows normal versioning rules
#   geos (C++), which uses -release, and changes on every release

# According to the geos project (as documented in README), the C++
# interface should not be directly used and other packages should not
# link against it.  Therefore, pkgsrc will perform a recursive revbump
# when the geos_c shlib version changes, and will generally ignore
# geos shlib name changes.

# The following packages incorrectly (from the geos viewpoint) link
# directly against -lgeos and should be revbumped on every update (and
# fixed not to use -lgeos):
#   geography/gdal-lib
