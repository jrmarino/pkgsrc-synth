This modules provides a file handle that hides the beginning of a file.
After opening, the file is positioned at the offset location. seek() and
tell() calls are modified to preserve the offset.

The Tie::Handle::SkipHeader subclass of Tie::Handle::Offset
automatically hides an email-style message header.  After opening the
file, it reads up to a blank or white-space-only line and sets the
offset to the next byte.
