SDoP is a Simple DocBook Processor. It reads DocBook XML input and
writes PostScript output. This version has some support for almost
all the elements that are part of Simplified DocBook. The main
omissions are support for bibliographies, multiple authors, subtables
within tables, and some element attributes.
