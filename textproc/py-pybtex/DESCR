Pybtex aims to be 100% compatible with BibTeX. It accepts the same command line
options, fully supports BibTeX's .bst styles and produces byte-identical output.

Additionally,

* Pybtex is Unicode-aware.
* Pybtex supports bibliography formats other than BibTeX.
* It is possible to write formatting styles in Python.
* As a bonus, Pythonic styles can produce HTML, Markdown and other markup
  besides the usual LaTeX.

Pybtex also includes a Python API for managing bibliographies from Python.
