Aspic is a program that processes a textual description of a line
art graphic, and converts it into a form that is suitable for
inclusion in another document. The default output format is
Encapsulated PostScript, but there is also support for Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG), and there is legacy support for the SGCAL
text processor.
