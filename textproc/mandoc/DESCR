The mandoc manual page parser and formatter package contains:
 * the man(1) program to display manual pages
 * the apropos(1) program to search for manual pages
 * semantic search, regular expressions, and logical operators
 * the makewhatis(8) program to build manual page databases
 * the catman(8) program for bulk formatting of many pages
 * the man.cgi(8) program to serve manual pages on the web
 * complete validating parsers for the mdoc(7) and man(7) languages
 * slightly incomplete parsers for the tbl(7) and eqn(7) languages
 * support for some selected roff(7) requests that occur in manuals
 * complete ASCII, UTF-8, and HTML text output formatters
 * simple PostScript and PDF output formatters
 * translators from the mdoc(7) to the man(7) and markdown languages
 * output formatters producing indented mdoc(7) and man(7) parse trees

To format manuals for console display, it can be used as a smaller
and faster drop-in replacement for nroff -mandoc.  Some rare manuals
using lots of uncommon low-level roff requests may not work with
mandoc but require a full roff implementation.
