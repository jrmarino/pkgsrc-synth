cdif is a post-processor of the Unix diff command. It highlights
deleted, changed and added words based on word context.

To compare character-by-character rather than word-by-word, use the -B
option.

If only one file is specified, cdif reads that file (stdin if no file)
as a output from diff command.

Lines that don't look like diff output are simply ignored and printed.
