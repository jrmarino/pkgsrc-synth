digest provides hash function summaries for GNU R objects. The md5,
sha-1, sha-256 and crc32 hash functions are available. The md5
algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the SHA-1 and
SHA-256 algorithm is specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2,
respectively, and the crc32 algorithm is described in here. For md5,
sha-1 and sha-256, this packages uses small standalone C
implementations that were provided by by Christophe Devine. For crc32,
code from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, a routine by Aaron
Gifford is used. Please note that this package is not meant to be
deployed for cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and
widely tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
