OTX Direct Connect agents provide a way to automatically update your
security infrastructure with pulses you have subscribed to from with
Open Threat Exchange. By using Direct Connect, the indicators
contained within the pulses you have subscribed to can be downloaded
and made locally available for other applications such as Intrusion
Detection Systems, Firewalls, and other security-focused applications.
