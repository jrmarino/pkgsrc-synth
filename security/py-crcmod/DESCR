The software in this package is a Python module for generating objects that
compute the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). There is no attempt in this package
to explain how the CRC works. There are a number of resources on the web that
give a good explanation of the algorithms.

This package allows the use of any 8, 16, 24, 32, or 64 bit CRC. You can
generate a Python function for the selected polynomial or an instance of the
Crc class which provides the same interface as the md5 and sha modules from the
Python standard library. A Crc class instance can also generate C/C++ source
code that can be used in another application.
