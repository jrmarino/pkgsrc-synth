GrafX2 is a drawing program dedicated to pixelart and low-color
graphics. This program is dedicated to everybody who knows what a
single pixel is. Its layout is not very different from the famous
Deluxe Paint or Brilliance, so it will be quite easy to handle it
if you know at least one of these programs. If you aren't used to
the art of drawing with up to 256 colors, it will be a little more
difficult for you, but you should give it a try (or more, because
most of the power of this program won't show up on the first try).
Then, you might eventually like to draw the oldskool way !
