libdmtx is a software library that enables programs to read and
write Data Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. The
library runs natively on several platforms and can be accessed by
multiple languages using the libdmtx language wrappers. The
utility programs dmtxread and dmtxwrite also provide a command
line interface for libdmtx, and serve as a good reference for
developers writing their own libdmtx-enabled programs.
