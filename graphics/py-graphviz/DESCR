This package facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions in
the DOT language of the Graphviz graph drawing software (master repo) from
Python.

Create a graph object, assemble the graph by adding nodes and edges, and
retrieve its DOT source code string. Save the source code to a file and render
it with the Graphviz installation of your system.
