The HP-15C Simulator is intended to be a useful RPN calculator for
your PC desktop. It therefore makes use of the features of the
underlying operating system and its GUI: Programs can be saved in
files, so that you need to key them in only once. Pop-up menus provide
easy and fast access to many HP-15C functions and features. However,
no new function, which is not supported by the real HP-15C, is added.

The Simulator supports almost all functions and features of the real
HP-15C. Differences between the real HP-15C and the Simulator are
rather small.
