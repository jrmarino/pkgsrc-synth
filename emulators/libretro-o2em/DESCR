Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

O2EM is an open source multi-platform Magnavox Odyssey2 / Videopac+
emulator. The Odyssey2 (Videopac/Jopac in Europe) was a video game
console created in the late 70s.
