Shaders and filters can be applied to video games to achieve some kind of
visual effect. These can be from attempting to replicate CRT displays, RF
cables, smooth scaling and anti-aliasing, or something more exotic.

This package contains the shaders provided by the libretro project for use
with RetroArch (where .glsl and .glslp shaders are supported out of the box).

They could also in theory be used with other OpenGL programs.

For more information, including examples of specific shaders, see the
