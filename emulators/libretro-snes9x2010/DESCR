Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the
easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug
straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is
open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores
also in their own programs or devices.

This is a port of Snes9x 1.52+ to Libretro (previously called SNES9x Next),
rewritten in C with several optimizations and speed hacks.

Snes9x is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom emulator.
