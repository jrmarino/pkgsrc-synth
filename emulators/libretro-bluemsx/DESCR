Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

blueMSX is a cycle accurate emulator for MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and MSX
TurboR-based home computers as well as the ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000
video game systems.
