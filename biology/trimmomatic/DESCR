Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina
paired-end and single ended data. The selection of trimming steps and their
associated parameters are supplied on the command line. It works with FASTQ
(using phred + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores, depending on the Illumina
pipeline used), either uncompressed or gzipp'ed FASTQ.
