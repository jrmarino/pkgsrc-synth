carton is a command line tool to track the Perl module dependencies for
your Perl application. Dependencies are declared using cpanfile format,
and the managed dependencies are tracked in a cpanfile.snapshot file,
which is meant to be version controlled, and the snapshot file allows
other developers of your application will have the exact same versions
of the modules.
