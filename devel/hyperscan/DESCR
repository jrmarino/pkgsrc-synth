Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library. It
follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre
library, but is a standalone library with its own C API. Hyperscan
uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of
large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions and for
the matching of regular expressions across streams of data.
