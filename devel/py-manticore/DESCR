Manticore is a symbolic execution tool for analysis of binaries and smart
contracts.

Manticore features Input Generation (automatically generates inputs that trigger
unique code paths), Crash Discovery (discovers inputs that crash programs via
memory safety violations), Execution Tracing (records an instruction-level trace
of execution for each generated input), and Programmatic Interface (exposes
programmatic access to its analysis engine via a Python API).

Manticore can analyze Linux ELF binaries (x86, x86_64 and ARMv7) and Ethereum
smart contracts (EVM bytecode).
