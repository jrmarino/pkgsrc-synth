$NetBSD: patch-requests_____init____.py,v 1.3 2018/06/16 13:08:32 adam Exp $

* Allow newer py-urllib3 and py-chardet.
* Add workaround for segfault of security/py-certbot on NetBSD/amd64
  7.0.2 and 7.99.53. It seems that the real root cause is in
  security/py-OpenSSL or OpenSSL. However I do not find how to fix it.

  This is introduced in https://github.com/shazow/urllib3
