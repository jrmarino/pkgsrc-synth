Tmin is a simple utility meant to make it easy to narrow down
complex test cases produced through fuzzing. It is closely related
to another tool of this type, delta, but meant specifically for
unknown, underspecified, or hard to parse data formats (without
the need to tokenize and re-serialize data), and for easy integration
with external UI automation harnesses.

It also features alphabet normalization to simplify test cases that
could not be shortened.
