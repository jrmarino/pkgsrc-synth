Ruby-rcov is a code coverage tool for Ruby.  It is commonly used for
viewing overall test unit coverage of target code.  It features fast
execution (20-300 times faster than previous tools), multiple analysis
modes, XHTML and several kinds of text reports, easy automation with
Rake via a RcovTask, fairly accurate coverage information through code
linkage inference using simple heuristics, and colorblind-friendliness.
