Menlo::Legacy is a package to install Menlo::CLI::Compat which is a
compatibility library that implements the classic version of cpanminus
internals and behavios. This is so that existing users of cpanm and API
clients such as Carton, Carmel and App::cpm) can rely on the stable
features and specific behaviors of cpanm.

This way Menlo can evolve and be refactored without the fear of breaking
any downstream clients, including cpanm itself.
