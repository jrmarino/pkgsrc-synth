100+ extra functional tools that go beyond standard library's
itertools, functools, etc. and popular third-party libraries like
toolz, fancy, and more-itertools. Like toolz and others, most of the
tools are designed to be efficient, pure, and lazy. Several useful yet
non-functional tools are also included. While toolz and others target
basic scenarios, most tools in this library target more advanced and
complete scenarios. A few useful CLI tools for respective functions
are also installed. They are available as extratools-[funcname].
