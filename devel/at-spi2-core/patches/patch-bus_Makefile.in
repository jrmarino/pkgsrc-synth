Revert commit 2ef00769:

    Support a stateless configuration by default
    
    Using a stateless configuration, we ship sensible defaults in
    our vendor-config file to live in the /usr/share/ filesystem,
    which is considered to be provided by the vendor, and to all
    intents and purposes, read-only.
    
    With this change we can fall-back to the vendor system
    configuration to always do the right thing, in the absence of
    a local system administrator configuration file in the /etc/
    tree.
    
    Notably, this saves users from the potential risks and pitfalls
    of so called "three way merges" on upgrades, and offers the
    immediate benefit that one can perform a factory reset of the
    software, simply by removing the relevant file in /etc/.
    
    This change also resolves a memory leak in the launch code,
    where a string allocation was entirely unnecessary.

The above change essentially uses $(datadir)/defaults/at-spi2 the
way we use the examples directory, so stick to using the pkgsrc
CONF_FILES mechanism.
