`multiprocessing` is a back port of the Python 2.6/3.0
`multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`
package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version
of R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`
package.
This standalone variant is intended to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5,
and will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.
