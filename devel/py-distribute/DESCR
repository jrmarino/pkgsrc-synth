Distribute is a fork of the Setuptools project.
The fork has two goals:
-Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools and make all
 distributions that depend on Setuptools work as before, but with less bugs
 and behaviorial issues.
 Distribute supports Python 3.
-Refactoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions. This work
 is being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.
