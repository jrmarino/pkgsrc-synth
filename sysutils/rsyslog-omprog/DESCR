This module permits to integrate arbitrary external programs into
rsyslog's logging.  It is similar to the "execute program (^)" action,
but offers better security and much higher performance. While "execute
program (^)" can be a useful tool for executing programs if rare events
occur, omprog can be used to provide massive amounts of log data to a
program.
