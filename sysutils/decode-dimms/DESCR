decode-dimms is a small utility that displays the contents of DIMM memory
SPD ROMs in human-readable form.  (It is part of a larger collection of
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/i2c-tools - most of which is very
Linux-specific.)

This version of decode-dimms can even directly read the SPD ROM data from
the sysctl variables created by NetBSD's spdmem(4) device driver.
