Euca2ools are command line tools used to interact with Amazon Web
Services (AWS) as well as other services that are compatible with AWS,
such as Eucalyptus.  They aim to use the same input as similar tools
provided by AWS for each service individually along with several
enhancements that make them easier to use with multiple clouds at once.
