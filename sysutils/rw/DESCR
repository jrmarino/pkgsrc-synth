Sortix rw is a program that reads blocks from the standard input and copies them
to the standard output until the end of the standard input. rw(1) is designed to
be a replacement for dd(1), providing only the the core blockwise I/O. It has a
standard command line interface with dashed options, useful and efficient
defaults, and is simpler because it doesn't support converting the input (e.g.
converting ASCII to/from EBCDIC).
