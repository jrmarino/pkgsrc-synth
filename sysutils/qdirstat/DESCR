QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space has gone and
to help you to clean it up.

This is a Qt-only port of the old Qt3/KDE3-based KDirStat, now based on the
latest Qt 5. It does not need any KDE libs or infrastructure. It runs on every
X11-based desktop on Linux, BSD and other Unix-like systems.
