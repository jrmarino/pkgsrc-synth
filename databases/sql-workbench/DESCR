SQL Workbench/J is a free, DBMS-independent, cross-platform SQL
query tool. It is written in Java and should run on any
operating system that provides a Java Runtime Environment.

Its main focus is on running SQL scripts (either interactively
or as a batch) and export/import features. Graphical query
building or more advanced DBA tasks are not the focus and are
not planned.

Features:

 * Edit, insert and delete data directly in the query result.
 * Powerful export command to write text files (aka "CSV"),
   XML, HTML or SQL (including BLOB data). All user tables
   can be exported into a directory with a single command.
   Export files can be compressed "on-the-fly".
 * Powerful text, XML and spreadsheet import. A set of files
   (including compressed files) can be imported from a directory
   with a single command. Foreign key constraints are detected
   to insert the data in the correct order.
 * Compare two database schemas for differences. The XML output
   can be transformed into the approriate SQL ALTER statements
   using XSLT.
 * Compare the data of two database and generate the necessary
   SQL statements to migrate one to the other.
 * Supports running SQL scripts in batch mode.
 * Supports running in console mode.
 * Search text in procedure, view and other sources using a SQL
   command or a GUI.
 * Search for data across all columns in all tables using a SQL
   command or a GUI.
 * Reformatting (Pretty-Print) of SQL Statements.
 * Select rows from related tables according to their foreign
   key definitions.
 * Tooltips for INSERT statements to show the corresponding
   value or column.
 * Copy data directly between to database servers using a SQL
   command or a GUI.
 * Macros (aka aliases) for frequently used SQL statements.
 * Variable substitution in SQL statements including smart
   prompting for values (can be combined with macros).
 * Auto completion for tables and columns in SQL statements.
 * Display database objects and their definitions.
 * Display table source.
 * Display view, procedure and trigger source code.
 * Display foreign key constraints between tables.
 * Full support for BLOB data in query results, SQL statements,
   export and import.
 * SQLWorkbench/J is free for almost everyone (published under
   a modified the Apache 2.0 license).
