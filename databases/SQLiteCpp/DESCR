SQLiteC++ offers an encapsulation arround the native C APIs of SQLite,
with a few intuitive and well documented C++ class.  It is designed
using the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idom, and
throwing exceptions in case of SQLite errors (exept in destructors,
where assert() are used instead).  Each SQLiteC++ object must be
constructed with a valid SQLite database connection, and then is
always valid until destroyed.
