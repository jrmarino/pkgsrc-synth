The Twitter API keys (CK/CS) for mikutter has been suspended since
May 4th 2018, so currently mikutter cannot connect to Twitter APIs
and you cannot use mikutter as a Twitter client with the default settings.

While mikutter is not only a Twitter client but can also be used as
a client for misc SNS services like Mastodon etc., you can still use
Twitter via mikutter by getting your own Twitter CK/CS and using the
"twitter_api_keys" plugin.

See @Akkiesoft's document "How to make mikutter work again" for details:
