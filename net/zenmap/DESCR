Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI. It is a multi-platform
(Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, etc.) free and open source application which
aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while providing advanced features
for experienced Nmap users. Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to
make them easy to run repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive creation
of Nmap command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later. Saved scan
results can be compared with one another to see how they differ. The results of
recent scans are stored in a searchable database.
