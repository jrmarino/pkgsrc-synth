Torsocks allows you to use most applications in a safe way with
Tor. It ensures that DNS requests are handled safely and explicitly
rejects any traffic other then TCP from the application you're
using.

Torsocks is an ELF shared library that is loaded before all others.
The library overrides every needed Internet communication libc
function calls such as connect(2) or gethostbyname(3).

This process is transparent to the user and if torsocks detects
any communication that can't go through the Tor network such as
UDP traffic for instance, the connection is denied. If, in some
way, there is no way for torsocks to provide the Tor anonymity
guarantee with your application, torsocks will force the application
to quit and stop everything.
