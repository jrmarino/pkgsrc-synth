A Perl library to access Domain Name Registries/Registrars:
DRI stands for Domain Registration Interface and aims to be,
for domain name registries/registrars/resellers
what Perl DBI is for databases.

Net::DRI offers a uniform API to access services.
It can be used by registries to test their systems.
It can be used by registrars to access registries.
It can be used by clients to access registrars and/or resellers.
It can be used by anonyone to do whois, DAS or IRIS DCHK queries.

It is an OO framework that can be easily extended to
handle various protocols (RRP, EPP, custom protocols) and
various transports methods (TCP, TLS, SOAP, email, etc...).
