Subunit is a streaming protocol for test results.

A number of useful things can be done easily with subunit:
* Test aggregation: Tests run separately can be combined and then
  reported/displayed together. For instance, tests from different languages can
  be shown as a seamless whole, and tests running on multiple machines can be
  aggregated into a single stream through a multiplexer.
* Test archiving: A test run may be recorded and replayed later.
* Test isolation: Tests that may crash or otherwise interact badly with each
  other can be run seperately and then aggregated, rather than interfering with
  each other or requiring an adhoc test->runner reporting protocol.
* Grid testing: subunit can act as the necessary serialisation and
  deserialiation to get test runs on distributed machines to be reported in
  real time.
