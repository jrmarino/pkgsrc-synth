To try to get pkgsrc working on your system, please try the following
as root:

# ./bootstrap
    [ --workdir <workdir> ]
    [ --prefix <prefix> ]
    [ --pkgdbdir <pkgdbdir> ]
    [ --sysconfdir <sysconfdir> ]
    [ --varbase <varbase> ]
    [ --ignore-case-check ]
    [ --ignore-user-check ]
    [ --preserve-path ]
    [ --help ]

The defaults for the arguments are as follows:

	--prefix	/usr/pkg
	--pkgdbdir	/usr/pkg/pkgdb
	--sysconfdir	/usr/pkg/etc
	--varbase	/var
	--workdir	work

The working directory will be created if it doesn't exist and has to be
writable by the user executing ./bootstrap.

The bootstrap script will exit if the bootstrap directory already exists,
for example if you have run the script before. In this case, clean it up
by running:

# ./cleanup

Make sure that you have a working C compiler and make(1) binary in
your path.  Please note that on some systems (IRIX and SunOS, for example),
the bootstrap script will look into a number of common directories for
alternative implementations of some tools.  If they are found, these
directories will be prepended to the PATH variable, unless the
'--preserve-path' flag is given.

See pkgsrc/doc/pkgsrc.txt or
http://www.NetBSD.org/docs/software/packages.html for
more information about bootstrapping and using pkgsrc.

We'd be very interested in hearing of any successes or failures on
"unknown" (to us) systems.

Please remember to add $prefix/bin to your PATH environment variable
and $prefix/man to your MANPATH environment variable, if necessary.
(See above for --prefix and its default value.)

The bootstrap script will create an example mk.conf file located
in your work directory as "mk.conf.example". It contains the
settings you provided to the bootstrap. Copy it to your
$sysconfdir directory (see above about --sysconfdir and its default
value). If the default mk.conf doesn't already exist, the example is
copied into place.
