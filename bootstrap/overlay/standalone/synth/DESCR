Synth is a custom packge repository builder for the FreeBSD Ports
Collection that has been ported to pkgsrc.

It is intended to replace Portmaster, portupgrade, and poudriere for
the average user.  
It is intended for the average user and to be simple to learn (the
powerful options are limited in number) and user-friendly, but it is
extremely fast due to its parallel building capability.  It requires
the pkg(8)-driven version of pkgsrc.  All packages are built in a
clean environment, so it is finally safe to build them as needed on a
live system.  The default profile is the system itself, not a new jail,
which can be a valuable feature for some environments.

To bring a system up-to-date only requires one command after the ports
tree is updated:

  > synth upgrade-system

During the building process, a curses-based display will show the status
of all the builders and the entire bulk run process. A dynamic and
searchable web-based report is generated simultaneously.  Synth requires
no preparation; it works immediately upon installation.
