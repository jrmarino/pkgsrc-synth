PKGSRC-SYNTH
============

This is a systematically modified version of pkgsrc (https://www.pkgsrc.org).
It is constructed by applying an overlay to stock version and generated every
six hours.  The modification allows pkgsrc to create binary packages suitable
for use by FreeBSD's pkg(8) binary package management tool
(https://github.com/freebsd/pkg) rather than the older pkg_* tools.  This in
turn allows John Marino's local repository builder known as Synth
(https://github.com/jrmarino/synth) to be adapted to pkgsrc.

Differences between PkgSrc-Synth and vanilla PkgSrc:
  1. Adds pkgng format (Initial work by Pierre Pronchery)
  2. Removes pkg_install dependency
  3  Adds very small pkgng_admin dependency for licenses and matching
  4. Stores overlay sources at bootstrap/overlay
  5. Omits the unreliable (and thus extra useless) docs/CHANGES-* and
     docs/TODO* files
  6. Contains synth source
