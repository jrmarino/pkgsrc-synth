PKGSRC-SYNTH
============

This is a systematically modified version of pkgsrc (https://www.pkgsrc.org).
It is constructed by applying an overlay to stock version and generated every
six hours.  The modification allows pkgsrc to create binary packages suitable
for use by FreeBSD's pkg(8) binary package management tool
(https://github.com/freebsd/pkg) rather than the older pkg_* tools.  This in
turn allows John Marino's local repository builder known as Synth
(https://github.com/jrmarino/synth) to be adapted to pkgsrc.

Differences between PkgSrc-Synth and vanilla PkgSrc:
  1. Adds pkgng format (Initial work by Pierre Pronchery)
  2. Replaces pkg_install everywhere
  3. Stores overlay patches at bootstrap/overlay
  4. Omits the unreliable (and thus extra useless) docs/CHANGES-* files
  5. Contains synth source
