     Close out the entry just written.	In particular, this writes out the
     final padding required by some formats.  Ordinarily, clients never need
     to call this, as it is called automatically by 1marchive_write_header22m() and
     1marchive_write_close22m() as needed.

1mRETURN VALUES0m
     This function returns 1mARCHIVE_OK 22mon success, or one of several non-zero
     error codes for errors.  Specific error codes include: 1mARCHIVE_RETRY 22mfor
     operations that might succeed if retried, 1mARCHIVE_WARN 22mfor unusual condi‐
     tions that do not prevent further operations, and 1mARCHIVE_FATAL 22mfor seri‐
     ous errors that make remaining operations impossible.

1mERRORS0m
     Detailed error codes and textual descriptions are available from the
     1marchive_errno22m() and 1marchive_error_string22m() functions.
