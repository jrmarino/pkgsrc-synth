Solves systems of equations using Krammer's rule. If you look at the
Solve method you'll understand Krammer's rule (I think?)

Basically a system of equations is more than one equation/variable your
solving. This module REQUIRES you have 1 equation per each coefficent.
Try not to use too many equations. 3 equations is probably the limit of
reason. But if you don't mind long compilation time, go for as many as
you want.

This module uses (and ovbiously requires you have) Math::Matrix to do
all the Matrix work. Please take a look at that module for details do
you can see exactly what is happening. There are no arguements in this
module except for the Matrix which will be brought to Math::Matrix.

Also, keep in mind, there are no error messenging. I will of course
change that someday, but for now I'm satisfied that I can solve systems
of equations. Don't allow error-prone things to be written in. But,
there are of course times when you won't be able to figure out the
stupid answer and this module will absolutly act like it did a great
job, and at the same time, fail. So, keep that in mind.

BETA means something. It's not good.
