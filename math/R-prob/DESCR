A framework for performing elementary probability calculations on
finite sample spaces, which may be represented by data frames or
lists.  Functionality includes setting up sample spaces, counting
tools, defining probability spaces, performing set algebra,
calculating probability and conditional probability, tools for
simulation and checking the law of large numbers, adding random
variables, and finding marginal distributions.  Characteristic
functions for all base R distributions are included.
