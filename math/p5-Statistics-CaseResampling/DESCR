The purpose of this perl module is to calculate the median (or in
principle also other statistics) with confidence intervals on a sample.
To do that, it uses a technique called bootstrapping. In a nutshell, it
resamples the sample a lot of times and for each resample, it calculates
the median. From the distribution of medians, it then calculates the
confidence limits.
