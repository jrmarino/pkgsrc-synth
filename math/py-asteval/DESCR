ASTEVAL is a safe(ish) evaluator of Python expressions and statements, using
Python's ast module. The idea is to provide a simple, safe, and robust
miniature mathematical language that can handle user-input. The emphasis here
is on mathematical expressions, and so many functions from numpy are imported
and used if available.
