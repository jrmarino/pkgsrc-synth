Provides a convenient interface for using Adobe's freely available Type
1 Euro fonts. Loading the package defines a new command \euro which
typesets a Euro symbol. The symbol is always taken from the 'EuroSans'
family, with the weight (medium or boldface) and shape (normal or
oblique) varying according to the font currently selected. This Euro
symbol meets the official design and matches most font families well
enough, except for typewriter fonts. The fonts themselves are only
available from Adobe (though the fonts are free of charge, the licence
conditions prevent CTAN from distributing them). Metrics and maps for
using the fonts (at all) are available via the adobe-euro package.
