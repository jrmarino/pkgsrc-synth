The particular symbol printed by \euro will in general change depending
on the font family, weight, and shape in use at the time. This symbol
can come from any source, and the package user has complete control over
which euro symbol is used in any given situation. The package is
pre-configured to behave sensibly with many common text fonts and
available euro symbols. The \euro command can print 'faked' euro symbols
from a C with two lines across it when no suitable real euro symbol is
available; the package also includes code for printing fake bold euro
symbols for use when no real bold symbol exists, as well as
pre-configured support for a faked italic version of the marvosym font.
Eurofont comes set up to use euro symbols from Adobe's Eurofonts, the
marvosym font, the Eurosym font, and any available Text Companion fonts.
The selection between these can be done using options passed to the
package. The eurofont package also 'knows' about the China2e font's euro
symbol, and can be configured to use it.
