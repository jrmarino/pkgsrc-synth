$NetBSD: configuration.txt,v 1.2 2014/11/27 20:36:43 joerg Exp $

The configuration of the wrapper framework depends on two variables.
The environment variable CWRAPPERS_CONFIG_DIR points to a directory
with one configuration file per wrapper.

The configuration file consists of simple key=value pairs.  It is
case-sensitive and all spaces are considered part of the value.

Lists of keys:

worklog: Name of logfile to append to.

exec: Name of the target command to exec(2).

path: Override current value of the environmental variable PATH before
calling the wrappee.

reorder: Specify a reorder rule.  See reorder.txt for the details.

transform: Specify a transformation rule.  See generic-transform.txt for
the details.

prepend: Prepend an option directly after logging the original command.
The options are inserted in the order of the config file.

append: Append an option directly after logging the original command.
The options are inserted in the order of the config file.
