This installs pkgng_admin which provides a very limited subset of
functions that pkg_admin does.  The latter is an administration tool
required for the original package format.

Remaining functionality:
 - check-license <condition>         check if condition is acceptable
 - check-single-license <license>    check if license is acceptable
 - pmatch pattern pkg                returns true if pkg matches pattern

These are used throughout the tree, especially pmatch.
