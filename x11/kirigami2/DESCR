Kirigami is a set of QtQuick components at the moment targeted for
mobile use (in the future desktop as well) targeting both Plasma
Mobile and Android. It's not a whole set of components, all the
"Primitive" ones like buttons and textboxes are a job for
QtQuickControls (soon QtQuickControls2) but it's a set of high level
components to make the creation of applications that look and feel
great on mobile as well as desktop devices and follow the Kirigami
Human Interface Guidelines.
