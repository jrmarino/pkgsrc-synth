gdsCAD is a simple, but powerful, Python package for creating, reading, and
manipulating GDSII layout files. It's suitable for scripting and interactive
use. It excels particularly in generating designs with multiple incrementally
adjusted objects. gdsCAD uses matplotlib to visualize everything from individual
geometry primitives to the entire layout.
