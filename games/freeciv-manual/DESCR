HTML manual for Freeciv, including documentation for the game
itself, the client, and the server.  Information from the online
help is not duplicated.

This documentation is from 2000, but the basic game play has not
changed much since then.  More up-to-date documentation can be found
at http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/.
